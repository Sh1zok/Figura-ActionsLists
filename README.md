# Figura-ActionsLists
Having trouble with A TON of actions? Stop it, get some help.

This repository contains a script for Figure avatars created by me. This script will create a completely (almost) new action wheel element - *Action List*.<br/>
[Put demo-image here]<br/>
This script makes creating action lists easy and similar to creating a simple action. There are no unfamiliar variables. The action list can be created on any page of the action wheel.<br/>

## Script purpose
This script was created to solve three problems that create a TON of actions in the action wheel, here they are
* **Ugliness** - Often, it's just too lazy to create a bunch of textures or pick the right items to design an action. At such moments, a block of stone or something else is left on the icon of all actions.
* **Confusion in actions** - If there are too many actions on the page, you can simply get confused in them and forget where to click.
* **HUGE code duplication** - Sometimes the design of each action (title, icon, background color, hover color, etc.) takes up many lines in the file. But what if there are 15 such actions and the number of lines spent on setting them up exceeds a hundred? Can you quickly navigate the code?

## How does this script solve these problems?
* **Accuracy** - Since this script allows you to collect all these actions in a neat TEXT list, there is no longer a need to draw textures and select items for the icon of each action. At the same time, the ability to add a texture or item to the icon for each individual action remains.
* **Everything in one place** - Action names are visible at once. You can immediately understand which one you need.
* **Clean Code** - Designing a list of actions can, in the long run, reduce the number of lines written by tens of times.

## How to install this script?
The process of installing the script is quite simple
1. Download the script from this repository.
2. Place it in the directory with your avatar.
3. Add it to the `autoScripts` list in avatar.json(If you have this list)
4. Done. Have fun!
